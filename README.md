# Basic PyTorch Nerf Implementation

this is a simple Nerf implementation, for the most part copied from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TppdSsLz8uKoNwqJqDGg8se8BHQcvg_K?usp=sharing#scrollTo=jVAGjdUthecA) and somewhat adapted. 
The goal is simply to go through the code, understand it and test/play around. 


## build and develop

repo is setup as python package, simply open a python console at root and enter 

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

to install a editable version of the package for development. 
For usage only enter 
```
pip install .`
```
